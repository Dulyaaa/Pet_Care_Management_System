# üêï Pet Care Management System

## `"Only the best for your Dog"`
The Pet Care Management System helps to take care of your lovely pets by providing different services. The system is a website where the any user of the system can view the pet details, pets‚Äô accessories details, veterinary service details, and pet boarding kennel places before they come to the shop. Also, they can search the before mentioned details as much as quickly on the website.
The admin of the system can perform all the operations on the website. Once he/she log in to the system as an admin by entering exact username and password can view the admin dashboard. At there they can view summary of website. Following are the main operations that can be performed by admin on the website.
